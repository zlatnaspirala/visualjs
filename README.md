## Installation and setup  : ##


  In server Instance folder (navigate to server_instance/)

**1) Install next modules :** 

In node.js command prompt or console enter next installation command : 

```
#!javascript



npm install mysql
npm install delivery
npm install express
npm install mkdirp
npm install socket.io
npm install nodemailer@0.7.0

```

## Setup config.js ##

You will find config.js in server_instance folder : (All node.js application you can find in same folder (server_instance) .
 Some app have local usage like editor.js )

```
#!javascript

module.exports = {

   VERSION : "0.5",
   PATH_OF_NODE_APP : "D:/PATH_TO_SERVER_INSTANCE_FOLDER/server/" ,  // EDIT HERE
   PATH_OF_WWW : "D:/xamp/htdocs/project_instance/", // PATH_TO_WWW  EDIT HERE
   EDITOR_PORT : "1013",
   REG_PATH : "users/",
   ACCOUNT_PORT  : 3666 , 
   DESTROY_SESSION_AFTER_X_mSECUNDS : 20000,
   
 
};


```

This is all .


#  CLIENT OR WEB APPLICATION 

**How to start :** 

       1) Copy program_instance/ folder to the www folder or use visual-js.exe and create new application (select folder for www and server path).
          Best way : dont edit ROOT/program_instance/ - make copy of project_instance for use . Reason is to save original library . Use copy/paste to make instance 
          client ans server folders(windows gui use it for creating new projects). No problem at all you can always download new clean project from web.
       2) OnPage editor local usage service : start server_instance/editor.js if you want to create game objects from web page . After setup your page you must build visual.js 
          file with command : 
          

```
#!javascript

node build_from_editor_to_visual_js_file.js 
```

          *Editor use lib/visual_script/ this folder for cache data -maybe you will need extra permission.*


       3) In browser navigate to project-instance folder (index.html)
      
          Click right button and you will see content menu . First item is **Add New game object** .
          Than your game object will show at web page. Right click on rectangle area to see game object context menu.
         	
# 	*local node.js application tools* (	*Use this in develop mode only*  ):  
	
# 	- server_instance/res.js  - create RESOURCE  js object (  ADD image or images for animation ) #
     
           Put image or images in one folder for example TEST_RES/  . Put that folder in this location **project_instance/res/** .
           run command :           
 
```
#!javascript

server_instance/node res.js 
```

           After finishing restart web page ind enter in console :  RESOURCE.TEST_RES

           RESOURCE have all images path data. When you create folder with image and build with *node res.js* we did not create images object.
           Images object will be created after you add animation to the game objects. 

           This is good because memory safe.

#ON/PAGE Editor 

# 	- server_instance/editor.js #

           create game objects direct in web browser view. Takes data from system folder lib/visual_scripts/ and generate code.
           After build you can found your code intro visual.js (node build_from_editor_to_visual_js_file.js)

          - server_instance/build_from_editor_to_visual_js_file.js (node.js app for local use) 
           ** ON-PAGE Editor** 

          If you use editor.js to visual create game object method , you must  start ***node build_from_editor_to_visual_js_file.js*** on the end of work. 
          This tool will create visual.js in folder starter/ with all your game object was created in editor style .


# 	- linux user #
          
          Linux user need terminal for all jobs . 
          Example : Start ON-PAGE editor with terminal / cmd
          start commands from terminal like this : /PATH_TO_SERVER_DIR/node editor.js
